   For the majority of my college career I have had an amazing opportunity to work with engineer monkeys throwing their wrenches and screws at a hunk of metal that we are throwing into space, Space and Satellite Systems. We will be launching our first CubeSAT summer 2021. I am very excited to see it go into space and see the pictures it takes of earth in low earth orbit.      

   I have an idea for the next cubesat mission which I have been developing for a little over one year. When I initially joined Space and Satellite Systems I was unsure about what our mission was exactly. I decided to take initiative on this matter once I became the lead for Computer Systems. I asked professors in atmospheric sciences to help me determine what I can do to benefit scientists in their research while also keeping in mind the undying passion engineers have for unsolvable physical problems. They gave me design requirements that we simply could not do. We had no funding for the instruments they wanted and we had never thrown anything into space yet. I decided to put the idea on a backburner while reading papers and refining my ideas. Now I am given the opportunity to help write a proposal for the second satellite mission.

What better way to hash out my ideas than write a blog post?

   How can cubesats help atmospheric scientists?
    
   Cubesats enable imagery and sensors in LEO. This provides an intimate view of the earth and surrounding atmosphere. Atmospheric scientists at UC Davis want to observe clouds, specifically their structure. In addition radiation leaving the Earth and specific metrics such as pollution content and ocean productivity. These are all factors that intertwine to give a picture of the state of our Earth. Much information coming directly from LEO through a cubesat, realtime, aids in delivering a clear picture about topics such as global warming.

   The analysis of this data can be done with machine learning models in order to predict future trends of the information coming from the cubesat. One idea that I am excited for is a string of cubesats in LEO.This string would allow for the information to be a bit more accurate and representative of a longer period of time. The scientists who I had a chance to speak with stressed the importance of
multiple observations of the same area, this leads to a better picture of our atmosphere.

  I enjoy brainstorming new ideas and generating solutions for interdisciplenary fields. I am excited to see how this upcoming mission goes and look forward to eventually seeing it go into space.
