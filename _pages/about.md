My research interests include quantum machine learning, quantum algorithms, and quantum information theory. If someone asked me where I would like to be in 20 years, I would tell them out of all possibilities I hope to stay a student. Learning is what I do best and applying what I learn is what I do for fun. Currently I am focusing on development of open source quantum algorithms and researching mathematics behind quantum machine learning.
