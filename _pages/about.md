Mridul is an undergraduate at UC Davis (2021) with concentration in Math and Scientific Computation and a minor in Education. He enjoys coding, reading, writing, and thinking. His research interests include quantum machine learning, quantum algorithms, and quantum information theory. 



Currently, Mridul is focusing on development of open source quantum algorithms and researching mathematics behind quantum machine learning. He has contributed to various open repositories including the flight OS for the cubeSAT REALOP, Pennylane's quantum machine learning repo, while creating open source libraries for HOSVD and sparse PCA. 



Mridul aspires to develop a novel quantum neural network. He is intrigued by the geometric and analytic mathematical relationships of quantum many-body systems and neural networks. More specifically, the neural network will use principles of quantum mechanics that inherently entangle the past and the future with the present.
