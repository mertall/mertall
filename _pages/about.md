Mridul is an undergraduate at University of California - Davis (2021) with concentration in Mathematics and Scientific Computation. He has proved his problem solving acumen through continual practice in diverse modes for defining a problem and diverse methodologies for finding solutions to the problem while bringing expansive experiences in delivering unique solutions to a problem.  

Mridul came into college as a Microbiology major and took Engineering Calculus on a simple pretense- to push his concieved notions of what he can learn and cannot learn. Mridul struggled greatly with Math throughout his life, he makes it a point to do the things he finds most challenging. This attitude has carried Mridul far, allowing him to delve into projects where he is not considered an expert but rather someone who is willing to learn, learns quickly, and delivers solutions.  

He picked up computer science as a side hobby his Freshman year of college after building gaming and workstation computers for friends throughout highschool. During his first and only data structures class Mridul questioned why we only assign bits a value of 0 or 1, rather why not utilize all numbers between 0 and 1. During this time Mridul had no clue what quantum computing was and how it works and more notably had no understanding of Electrical Engineering. Mridul intially saw the a beautiful parallel between inductive proofs and recursion while learning inductive proofs for the first time in MAT 108, introduction to Abstract Mathematics. After discussion with his MAT 108 TA about the parallels between induction and recursion, Mridul was given challenging proofs which he later found to be similar to the [Infinite Hotel Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel). In under 3 years he has learnt 8 languages contributing to projects utlizing each language. Mridul has also read textbooks and indsutry sources regarding core principles in full stack engineering and computational theory.    

Mridul's mind works to solve problems with creativty and logic while his heart plays to deliver meaningful work which provides applicable benefits. Currently, he is looking for a role within an organization with a high ceiling for growth and comfortability with experimental and disruptive ideas.

## My Experience

Currently Tech Lead at [Space and Satellite Systems](https://www.ucdspaceandsatellitesystems.com/)    
* Computer Vision and Automated CubeSat Operating System research accepted to UC (University of California) Davis Undergraduate Research Conference.    
* Space and Satellite Systems is funded by The Green Iniatiave Fund and NASA to deliver the first UC Davis CubeSat. Our defintion for success is recieving Earth Science data for Atmospheric Scientists at UC Davis- propelling research of Global Warming. I began my journey as a Software Engineer attending the [CubeSAT Conference of 2019](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m161803398875s/detail/overlay-view/urn:li:fsd_profileTreasuryMedia:(ACoAACPUQp8BFbg_2SYAMZP5IzlGJQriLrFAYAM,1589568728711)/). After talking with NASA, big and small CubeSat manufacturers, and other schools I gained and provided excellent insight into the strengths and weaknesses of our CubeSats technical systems. Follwing this conference I developed autonomous control systems and eventually earned a position as Tech Lead. I was given the opportunity to present in front of NASA engineers and researchers during the [Preliminary Design Review](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vQKaiEhmzjhkJINsw5upEErIL7w0eli49ZhPyFmvKlU/edit?usp=sharing) for the CubeSat. After delving deep into the technical system I decided to focus attention on managing human capital. In accordance I developed the [Agile Development Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HTuV9DAut5XUEbByYMVwbrtg67TxJGHilfT-uTqb6LQ/edit?usp=sharing) with help from Space and Satellite System's president. Most recently the CubeSat work I have been doing for almost 3 years ultimately became topics for research which were accepted to UC Davis. In addition I briefly took a few months to analyze overall computational effeciency of the system. I was able to reduce system time complexity by by O(N^2) through leveraging OOP and discarding multiple for loops that were being computed every half second.     

I was a Full Stack Engineer (2 month Contract) working with a company overseas. I consulted for their technical systems and eventually developed a $20,000 Peer to Peer LAMP Full Stack with Node.js, Unity, AWS, and C/C# (NDA).        

I was a Machine Learning Research Assitant of [Dr. Rishidev Chaudhuri's Research Group @ UC Davis Center for Neuroscience](https://chaudhurilab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/people/). I increased the rate of computation for predictive lab results- mapping rats' spatial movement to brain activity, due to development of Big Data Pipeline. Open sourced [Sparse PCA Backend](https://github.com/mridulsar/PCA).       
    
I was a AI Developer at VMware earning an opportunity with [Abhishek Purushothama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishekpurushothama/) due to my past experience with text pre processing and NLP. Utilized CoreNLP, Spacy, NLTK, BERT, SQUAD2.0, and distrubted systems to develop a business centric Question Answer Bot (NDA).

### My journey    
An atomic family miles from those they love    
I was given an opportunity     
to carry my familyâ€™s name     
No other choice     
this is the American game     
Continually looking for a path   
I am from the number [zero](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&ei=XQxAYPfABMP5-gSJ1bXQAw&q=+Brahmagupta+zero&oq=+Brahmagupta+zero&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQguEJMCMgYIABAHEB4yBggAEAcQHjIICAAQBxAFEB4yBggAEAgQHjIGCAAQBxAeOgcIABCwAxBDOgcILhCwAxBDOgQIABBDOggIABCxAxCDAToHCAAQsQMQQzoFCAAQsQM6AggAOgcILhANEJMCUL9fWNqAAWCcigFoAnACeACAAfcDiAHACpIBCzAuMy4wLjEuMC4xmAEAoAEBoAECqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwi345zllJXvAhXDvJ4KHYlqDToQ4dUDCAw&uact=5)    
I am no longer looking for a hero   

This journey is my own    
This took a long time to learn    
The trees dancing to the sound of the breeze    
The sun beating at its own ease   
A bee buzzing to their own tune    
pollinating for the next bloom    

We all continue with    
eyes full of passion    
hands filled with burden    
neck crook with fervor    
back taught with decision    

I continue my journey with no end in sight    
all I look for is my guiding light    
I open my eyes wider    
I close my fists tighter    
I continue on my endeavor

### Favorite Books

### Climbing Mount Improbable - Richard Dawkins     

 * A great read if you want to be properly and wholey convinced of Evolution. Beautiful diagrams and real life examples that somehow are in both your right and left brain.     
 
### 1984 - George Orwell

 * Big Brother is watching. 
 
### Macbeth - Shakespeare

 * To go looking for power rues your own destruction.    
 
### Matrix Methods in Data Mining and Pattern Recognition - Lars Eden

 * A great book of algorithms, each fundamental to many technical systems.   
 
### Inner Work - Robert Johnson     

 * A very interesting read about dreams and subconcious. The brain is very powerful yet pliable.    
 
### Thomas' Calculus     

 * I truly fell in love with Calculus and its applications when I began college as a Microbiology Major.    
 
### Siddartha - Hermann Hesse    

 * The answer to all of life's problems is the forest, reflection, and grit.   
 
### Fablehaven - Brandon Mull     

 * A book about magical creatures in a forest perserve which you can see after consuming magical cow milk. Captured my imagination as a child, still an all time faovrite. When I met Brandon Mull at a signing I cried out of joy.
