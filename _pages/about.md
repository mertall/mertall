### My journey    
An atomic family miles from those they love    
I was given an opportunity     
to carry my familyâ€™s name     
No other choice     
this is the American game     
Continually looking for a path   
I am from the number zero    
White man was my superhero    

This journey is my own    
This took a long time to learn    
The trees dancing to the sound of the breeze    
The sun beating at its own ease   
A bee buzzing to their own tune    
pollinating for the next bloom    

We all continue with    
eyes full of passion    
hands filled with burden    
neck crook with fervor    
back taught with decision    

I continue my journey with no end in sight    
all I look for is my guiding light    
I open my eyes wider    
I close my fists tighter    
I continue on my endeavor
