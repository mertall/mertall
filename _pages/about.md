Mridul is an undergraduate at UC Davis (2021) with concentration in Math and Scientific Computation and a minor in Education. He enjoys coding, reading, and thinking. His research interests include quantum machine learning, quantum algorithms, and quantum information theory. If someone asked Mridul where he would like to be in 20 years, Mridul would tell them out of all possibilities he hopes to stay a student in all areas of his life, always trying to learn more. Learning is what he does best and applying what he learns is what he does for fun.    
Currently, Mridul is focusing on development of open source quantum algorithms and researching mathematics behind quantum machine learning. He aspires to develop a novel quantum neural network. Mridul believes once his model has come into fruition it will 'tell the future'. Mridul is inspired to disrupt the fintech, biotech, and consumer tech industries with his research, grit, and passion.
