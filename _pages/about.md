Mridul is an undergraduate at UC Davis (2021) with concentration in Math and Scientific Computation and a minor in Education. He enjoys coding, reading, and thinking. His research interests include quantum machine learning, quantum algorithms, and quantum information theory. If someone asked Mridul where he would like to be in 20 years, Mridul would tell them out of all possibilities he hopes to stay a student in all areas of his life, always trying to learn more. Learning is what he does best and applying what he learns is what he does for fun. 



Currently, Mridul is focusing on development of open source quantum algorithms and researching mathematics behind quantum machine learning. He has contributed to various open repositories including the flight OS for the cubeSAT REALOP, Pennylane's quantum machine learning repo, and recently numpy's linalg module. He aspires to develop a novel quantum neural network. Principles of quantum mechanics inherently entangle the past and the future with the present. This relationship can be modeled with a quantum neural network to act as an object to evaluate multiple paths in space-time to then find the most optimal path.
